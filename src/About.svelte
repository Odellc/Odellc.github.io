<h3 class="about">
      As a data scientist. I value integrity, communication, and problem
      solving. My values help me organize facts in systematic ways that
      influence decision making through clear communication. As a result, I can
      think of new ways to make an impactful difference in real life problems. I
      would like to be known for great reliable and accurate work that can be
      counted on in a continuous basis.
